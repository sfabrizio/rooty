## Install

```

## Run

npm run start

## TODO (This is a work in progress)

- Finish the basic app functionality: assign groups, see details & deletion
- Add form validations.
- Improve styles
- Add babel for cross browser compatibility (at the moment It was tested only in Chrome) 
- Add webpack for build the bundle.js
- Add unit tests with Jasmine
- Create login functionality 
- Add more offline features 
- Add search functionality  
- Write a simple backend in Node + Express + MongoDB



> **Note:** 
> This is only the FrontEnd part. I'm using mockup data at the moment. But these are the endpoints expected to have on the Backend:

- `/users` with methods [GET,POST, PUT & DELETE]
- `/groups` with methods [GET,POST, PUT & DELETE]
- `/login` with method [POST]
